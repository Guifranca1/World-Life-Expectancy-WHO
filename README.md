<h1 align="center">Project Overview</h1>

</br>
This project analyzes global life expectancy data from the World Health Organization (WHO), exploring trends and patterns across countries. It provides tools for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to understand how life expectancy has evolved worldwide.
</br>
</br>

## Data Sources

</br>

World Life Expectancy Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "WorldLifeExpectancy.csv" file, containing detailed information about each country and life expectancy and other variables.

## Tools

</br>

- SQL Server - Data Cleaning and Data Analysis

<h1 align="center">Data Cleaning and Preparation</h1>

</br>

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

</br>

## 1. Data loading and inspection.

</br>

When we started analyzing the dataset, we noticed that:

- There were duplicated rows.
- Some items in the "Status" column were missing.
- Some items in the "Life Expectancy" column were missing.

</br>

## 2. Handling missing values.

</br>

First, let's handle the duplicate rows using the following queries.

There are two columns that we can use to create a 'filter' for the duplicate rows. For each 'Country,' there is a corresponding 'Year,' and if we combine these two, we have a functional filter to identify duplicate rows:

</br>

```sql
# Finding the duplicate rows
SELECT Country, Year, CONCAT(Country, Year), COUNT(CONCAT(Country, Year))
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
GROUP BY Country, Year, CONCAT(Country, Year)
HAVING COUNT(CONCAT(Country, Year)) > 1;

# Finding the "Row_ID" correponding to the duplicate rows
SELECT *
FROM(
    SELECT Row_ID, CONCAT(Country, Year), ROW_NUMBER() OVER( PARTITION BY CONCAT(Country, Year) ORDER BY CONCAT(Country, Year)) AS Row_Num
    FROM worldlifeexpectancy
    ) AS Row_table
WHERE Row_Num > 1;

# Deleting the duplicate rows
DELETE FROM worldlifeexpectancy
WHERE Row_ID IN (SELECT Row_ID
                FROM( SELECT Row_ID, CONCAT(Country, Year), ROW_NUMBER() OVER( PARTITION BY CONCAT(Country, Year) ORDER BY CONCAT(Country, Year)) AS Row_Num
                    FROM worldlifeexpectancy) AS Row_table
                WHERE Row_Num > 1);
```

</br>

Now we need to address the blanks in the 'Status' column.

When we look at the data, we can observe that countries can be classified as 'Developed' or 'Developing.' The data is missing only for a few years, but not for all of them. To resolve this issue, we just need to check the type listed for the same country in another year.

</br>

```sql
# Finding the blanks or Nulls in "Status"
SELECT *
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
WHERE Status = '';

# Finding how many distinct status exists
SELECT DISTINCT(Status)
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
WHERE Status <> '';

# Updating the column with the missing values for Developing Countries
UPDATE worldlifeexpectancy a
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy b
  ON a.Country = b.Country
SET a.Status = 'Developing'
WHERE a.Status = ''
AND b.Status <> ''
AND b.Status = 'Developing';

# Updating the column with the missing values for Developed Countries
UPDATE worldlifeexpectancy a
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy b
  ON a.Country = b.Country
SET a.Status = 'Developed'
WHERE a.Status = ''
AND b.Status <> ''
AND b.Status = 'Developed';
``` 

</br>

Now we just need to find a solution for the missing values in the 'Life Expectancy' column.

It appears that for the missing values, the countries have been improving life expectancy each year. Therefore, we could assume the average value between the year before and after the missing data to fill in the 'Life Expectancy' column.

</br>

```sql
# Finding the Countries that "Life Expectancy" column is blank
SELECT *
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
WHERE `Life Expectancy` = '';

# Finding the average value for "Life Expectancy"
SELECT a.`Life Expectancy`,  b.`Life Expectancy`, c.`Life Expectancy`,
ROUND((b.`Life Expectancy` + c.`Life Expectancy`)/2, 1) AS avg_life_expectancy
FROM worldlifeexpectancy a
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy b
  ON a.Country = b.Country
  AND a.Year = b.Year - 1
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy c
  ON a.Country = c.Country
  AND a.Year = c.Year + 1
WHERE a.`Life Expectancy` = '';

# Updating the "Life Expectancy" column with the new values
UPDATE worldlifeexpectancy a
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy b
  ON a.Country = b.Country
  AND a.Year = b.Year - 1
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy c
  ON a.Country = c.Country
  AND a.Year = c.Year + 1
SET a.`Life Expectancy` = ROUND((b.`Life Expectancy` + c.`Life Expectancy`)/2, 1)
WHERE a.`Life Expectancy` = '';
```
